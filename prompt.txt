I resolved the question related to direct deposit and told him, “I sent the form via email.” Send the assignee on the task an email to let her know it’s handled, with the subject “Resolved” and the following message: Hi Lisa, I helped the new hire with his direct deposit inquiry. I know you have bigger items on your plate right now. Let me know if there’s anything else I can do to help you out.
